== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Invoice Management User Interface Plugin

The `crm-invoice-ui` plugin is a companion plugin to the `crm-invoice` plugin.
It provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for invoice management.

=== Create invoices

In most application invoices are created programatically based on information from the database or external systems.
But you can also create an invoice manually with the CrmInvoiceController.create() action.

=== Search invoices

To query for invoices you visit `crmIndex/index` which will show the query form.

You can enter query values in any field and then hit the `Search` button to search for invoices matching your query.
If you don't enter any query value all invoices will be included in the search result.

If the query result contains more than one invoice, an invoice list will be displayed. If the query result contains
exactly one invoice, then details for that invoice will be displayed.
I.e. it will skip the `list` view and go directly to the `show` view.

You can click on any invoice to show details for that invoice.

The `Export` button shows the *print/export* page but no layouts are provided by this plugin.
You must add an event `@Listener` in an application service that listens for the *crmInvoice.exportLayout* event and return layout definitions.
Look at https://github.com/technipelago/grails-crm-invoice-ui/blob/master/grails-app/controllers/grails/plugins/crm/invoice/CrmInvoiceController.groovy#L202[the source^] for `CrmInvoiceController#export()` for more information.

=== Invoice details

The invoice details page `crmInvoice/show` show all details for an invoice.
Here you will find invoice number, customer name, invoice and delivery addresses and more.

If the `crm-tags` plugin is installed you can see existing tags and add new tags to an invoice.

=== Edit invoice details

To edit invoice details you hit the `Edit` button. This will display the edit page `crmInvoice/edit`.
Here you can alter values and then hit `Save` to store the new values in the database.

Invoice items are listed on a separate tab. Items can be edited, added and deleted from this tab.
